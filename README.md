# Jquery-Racing-Game
This project is a 2D racing game that I've been working on the last few weeks

The user controls the yellow car and the objective is to avoid any crash with the red car (which has a random speed).
To get to the next level, the user must stay alive till the end of the music.

The game is developed with jquery. Anyone who's willing to improve it is more than welcome.
